## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

### Favorite Apps & Features

1. **Spotify**
   - Personalized playlists based on mood and taste
   - Simple and clean user interface

2. **Notion**
   - Customizable templates
   - Markdown support and fast syncing

3. **Instagram**
   - Reels and visual content discovery
   - Easy navigation and sharing

### App Idea

I'd like to build an app called **MindRipple** – a journaling and mental wellness app that helps people write short daily thoughts, track their mood, and reflect on how their emotional state changes over time. It would offer daily writing prompts, generate mood graphs, and recommend mindfulness exercises or affirmations based on trends. The goal is to make reflection simple and beautiful.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

- Initially, connecting the UIButton to the IBAction didn't work because the connection wasn’t properly set in Interface Builder. I had to use the Connections Inspector to delete and re-drag the link.
- I also had to move my Xcode project into the correct GitHub folder to enable version control with GitHub Desktop.
